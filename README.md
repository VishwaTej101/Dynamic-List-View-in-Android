Dynamic List View(Total Expanses List)

Aim: To create an Total Expenses List with names dynamically.

Approch:

Two Buttons are used 1.Add 2.Reset

Here after clicking on Add, An Alert Dialogue is created with edit text i.e asking for input. 

The input format is name of item in string and price of item is Int format.

 While the name of item and price is added dynamically as the input goes on.

finally the total expanses value is shown down below.


Conclusion:

All the beginner developers, developing apps in kotlin can learn how to use other Kotlin classes apart from MainActivity and also different xml files apart from 
Activity main xml file using inflation. Also can see how to create a an alert Dialogue, with input and toast.
