Dynamic List View(Total Expanses List)

Aim: To create a List of items with names and there expanses and add them dynamically. And finally get total Expanses.

Approch:

Two Buttons are used 1.Add 2.Reset

Here after clicking on Add, An Alert Dialogue is created with edit text i.e asking for input. 

The input format is name of item in string and price of item are taken.

and the using mutable list we add the items into it. While the price is added dynamically as the input goes on.

finally the total expanses value is shown down below.


Conclusion:

All the beginners developing apps in kotlin can learn how to use other Kotlin classes apart from MainActivity and also different xml files apart from 
Activity main xml file using inflation.
